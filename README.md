Here we show that limiting radial pedal forces has a detrimental effect on maximal average mechanical power output (AMPO).

Maximal AMPO dropped from 1094 W when no limit on radial forces was present to 477 W when no radial forces were allowed. 
Avoiding radial pedal forces causes ineffective use of muscles: muscles deliver less positive power and have a higher muscle power dissipation ratio (average mechanical power dissipated per unit of average positive power delivered). 

Radial pedal forces are an unavoidable byproduct when optimizing muscle stimulation over time for maximal AMPO and that limiting these lead to a performance decrease.
